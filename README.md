- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChessMaster1303, just a random kid who happens to like coding. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning), Python (which is also my preferred language of development, because I do not know any others, besides some basic Web Development languages) and Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Data Science (also through Python), and Web Development languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning and Web Development with In-Real-Life Friends.
- 📫 How to reach me: No official method right now, but maybe there will be an option to comment on my GitHub profile.
